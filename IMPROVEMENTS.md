# Code Improvements

## Critical Issues I'd Fix First

### Error Handling is Completely Missing

The biggest problem I see is that workers have zero error handling. If anything goes wrong - database timeout, network issue, invalid data - the entire worker just dies. 

In my experience, database operations fail all the time. Network hiccups, connection pool exhaustion, query timeouts - it's just reality. Without try-catch blocks, one bad message kills a worker permanently. If you're processing thousands of messages and workers keep dying, you'll eventually have zero workers left and everything stops.

I'd wrap all the database calls in proper error handling with retry logic. Maybe retry 3 times with exponential backoff, then send failed messages to a dead letter queue for manual review. This keeps workers alive and gives you visibility into what's failing.

### Messages Get Lost When Workers Crash

This is a silent killer I've dealt with before. A worker grabs a message, starts processing it, then crashes before confirming completion. That message just disappears into the void - it's not in the queue anymore, but it never got processed.

I've seen this happen with container restarts, out-of-memory kills, even developers accidentally killing processes during testing. The result is data inconsistency that's really hard to track down.

My fix would be adding timeouts to track messages. When a worker takes a message, start a 30-second timer. If it doesn't confirm completion, assume the worker died and requeue the message. After a few timeout attempts, move it to a dead letter queue.

## Performance Problems I'd Address

### That 10-Second Sleep is Terrible

Using a hard-coded 10-second sleep is just asking for trouble. Sometimes processing finishes in 2 seconds and you waste 8 seconds waiting. Sometimes it takes 15 seconds and you get incomplete results.

I've seen this pattern in production where batch jobs either timeout or waste massive amounts of compute time. It makes the system completely unpredictable.

I'd replace it with proper completion detection - poll the queue every 100ms until it's empty, with a reasonable maximum timeout as a safety net. This makes the system both faster and more reliable.

### No Worker Management

Right now workers are created and forgotten. When I'm debugging production issues, I need to know which workers are alive, how many messages they've processed, which ones are slow, etc. This fire-and-forget approach gives you zero visibility.

I'd build a proper WorkerPool that tracks worker lifecycle, provides stats, and can restart failed workers. When something goes wrong at 3 AM, you need this kind of operational visibility.

## Code Quality Issues

### Magic Numbers Everywhere

Hard-coded 3, 6, 100, 10000 scattered through the code drives me crazy. Want to test with different parameters? Good luck hunting through multiple files. Need to tune for production? Hope you find all the magic numbers.

I'd create a proper config system with named constants and environment variable overrides. This makes the code maintainable and lets you tune performance without code changes.

### Zero Observability

When this breaks in production, you'll have no idea why. Which messages are slow? Which workers are inefficient? What errors are happening? You're flying blind.

I've been called at 2 AM to debug "slow processing" with zero logs or metrics. It's miserable. I'd add structured logging, processing time metrics, error tracking, and regular status reports. 

### No Graceful Shutdown

Ctrl+C kills workers mid-operation, potentially corrupting data or leaving things in inconsistent states. Every deployment becomes a risky operation.

I'd add proper signal handling to finish in-flight work before shutting down. This makes deployments safe and prevents data loss during restarts.

**With key locking, graceful shutdown needs to**:
- Wait for all key locks to be released
- Ensure no messages are left in inconsistent states
- Properly clean up lock state before exit
